Hi!

I am Francois, a software engineer based in France.

I moved to UK in 2009 and, two years later, studied computer science at Imperial College London. I graduated in 2015 and started a career working on embedded systems, first at Imagination Technologies, then in a small company in Cambridge.

Since 2021, I am back in France, near Paris, working as a freelancer.

For the past 15 years, I am passionate about modelism, building numerous 1/48 aircraft scale models. I also built two remote-controlled boats. My current project is a remote-controlled submarine.
Along modelism, I have a keen interest in electronics, gradually improving my skills to reach a professional level. I especially enjoy designing custom boards on Kicad that I can put to use in a remote-control scale model.
